# **0x00 - Hello, World**

## **📌 Description**
This directory contains the first project in **low-level programming** using the **C language**. It covers fundamental topics like preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and printing output using `puts` and `printf`.

---

## **📂 Tasks**

### **0. Preprocessor**  
📌 Write a script that runs a C file through the **preprocessor** and saves the output to a file.  
- The C file name is stored in `$CFILE`.  
- The output is saved in `c`.  

📝 **File:** `0-preprocessor`

---

### **1. Compiler**  
📌 Write a script that **compiles a C file** without linking it.  
- The C file name is stored in `$CFILE`.  
- The output is saved as `.o` (object file).  

📝 **File:** `1-compiler`

---

### **2. Assembler**  
📌 Write a script that generates the **assembly code** of a C file.  
- The C file name is stored in `$CFILE`.  
- The output is saved as `.s`.  

📝 **File:** `2-assembler`

---

### **3. Name**  
📌 Write a script that **compiles a C file** and creates an executable named `cisfun`.  
- The C file name is stored in `$CFILE`.  

📝 **File:** `3-name`

---

### **4. Hello, puts**  
📌 Write a C program that prints:  
```
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
```
- Use `puts` (❌ `printf` not allowed).  
- Return `0`.  

📝 **File:** `4-puts.c`

---

### **5. Hello, printf**  
📌 Write a C program that prints:  
```
with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,
```
- Use `printf` (❌ `puts` not allowed).  
- Return `0`.  

📝 **File:** `5-printf.c`

---

### **6. Size is not grandeur**  
📌 Write a C program that prints the **size of various data types** on the system.  
- Must match the provided output.  
- Return `0`.  

📝 **File:** `6-size.c`
